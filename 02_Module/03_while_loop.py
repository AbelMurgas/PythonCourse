# Python while loop is used to run a block code until a certain 
# condition is met.
# program to display numbers from 1 to 5

# initialize the variable
# i = 1
# n = 5

# while loop from i = 1 to 5
# while i <= n:
#     print(i)
#     i = i + 1

# In Python, a while loop may have an optional else block.
# counter = 0

# while counter < 3:
#     print('Inside loop')
#     counter = counter + 1
# else:
#     print('Inside else')

# --- BREAK ---
# The break statement is used to terminate the loop immediately when it is encountered.

# Example:
# c = 0
# while (c<3): # This loop print (0, 1, 2)
#     print(c)
#     c+= 1

# c = 0
# while (c<3): # This loop print (0)
#     print(c)
#     break # Break the loop after print 0
#     c+= 1

# --- CONTINUE ---
# The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop
# and the control flow of the program goes to the next iteration.
# c = 0
# for i in range(3):# This loop print (0, 2)
#     if (i == 1):
#         continue # If i equal to 1 the for skip the next line(print)
#     print(i)

# --- PASS ---
# In Python programming, the pass statement is a null statement 
# which can be used as a placeholder for future code.
