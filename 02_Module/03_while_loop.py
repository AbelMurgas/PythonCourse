# Python while loop is used to run a block code until a certain 
# condition is met.
# program to display numbers from 1 to 5

# initialize the variable
# i = 1
# n = 5

# while loop from i = 1 to 5
# while i <= n:
#     print(i)
#     i = i + 1

# In Python, a while loop may have an optional else block.
