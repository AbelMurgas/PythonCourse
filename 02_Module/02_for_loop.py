# In Python, the for loop is used to run a block of code for a certain number of times. 
# It is used to iterate over any sequences such as list, tuple, string, etc.
# Example:
# languages = ['Swift', 'Python', 'Go', 'JavaScript']

# access items of a list using for loop
# for language in languages:
#     print(language)

# --- for Loop with Python range() ---

# use of range() to define a range of values
# values = range(4)

# iterate from i = 0 to i = 3
# for i in values:
#     print(i)
