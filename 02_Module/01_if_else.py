# In computer programming, we use the if statement to run a block code
#  only when a certain condition is met.

# If example
# number = 10

# check if number is greater than 0
# if number > 0:
#     print('Number is positive.')

# print('The if statement is easy')

# An if statement can have an optional else clause:
# number = 10

# if number > 0:
#     print('Positive number')

# else:
#     print('Negative number')

# print('This statement is always executed')

# The if...else statement is used to execute a block 
# of code among two alternatives.

# number = 0

# if number > 0:
#     print("Positive number")

# elif number == 0:
#     print('Zero')
# else:
#     print('Negative number')

# print('This statement is always executed')
