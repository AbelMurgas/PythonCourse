# --- Arithmetic Operators ---
# a = 7
# b = 2
# addition
# print ('Sum: ', a + b)  
# subtraction
# print ('Subtraction: ', a - b)   
# multiplication
# print ('Multiplication: ', a * b)  
# division
# print ('Division: ', a / b) 
# floor division
# print ('Floor Division: ', a // b)
# modulo
# print ('Modulo: ', a % b)  
# a to the power b
# print ('Power: ', a ** b)  

# --- Assignment Operators ---
# assign 10 to a
# a = 10
# assign 5 to b
# b = 5 
# assign the sum of a and b to a
# a += b      # a = a + b
# print(a)

# Output: 15

# --- Comparison Operators ---
# a = 5
# b = 2
# equal to operator
# print('a == b =', a == b)
# not equal to operator
# print('a != b =', a != b)
# greater than operator
# print('a > b =', a > b)
# less than operator
# print('a < b =', a < b)
# greater than or equal to operator
# print('a >= b =', a >= b)
# less than or equal to operator
# print('a <= b =', a <= b)

# --- Logical Operators ---
# logical AND
# print(True and True)     # True
# print(True and False)    # False
# logical OR
# print(True or False)     # True
# logical NOT
# print(not True)          # False

# --- Identity operators ---

# x1 = 5
# y1 = 5
# x2 = 'Hello'
# y2 = 'Hello'
# x3 = [1,2,3]
# y3 = [1,2,3]

# print(x1 is not y1)  # prints False

# print(x2 is y2)  # prints True

# print(x3 is y3)  # prints False

# --- Membership operators ---
# x = 'Hello world'
# y = {1:'a', 2:'b'}

# check if 'H' is present in x string
# print('H' in x)  # prints True

# check if 'hello' is present in x string
# print('hello' not in x)  # prints True

# check if '1' key is present in y
# print(1 in y)  # prints True

# check if 'a' key is present in y
# print('a' in y)  # prints False
